## What?
Pudu is an open source library that implements, with inspiration from Two Sigma's Flint, a summarizer class to do feature engineering on Polars dataframes. With the summarizer class primitives my goal is to implement fast time-series analysis for financial instruments.

Pudu is only a piece of the puzzle. To fully utilize the full performance of Polars, Pudu will be Quokka compatible. Check Quokka out [here](https://github.com/fabioibanez/quokka)
